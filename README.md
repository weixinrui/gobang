# gobang
The is my first project using C++
## Description
Gobang, also called *Five in Row*, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces on a go board. Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The program is a text game to simulate a gobang game. For easy to determaine which player wins, ther size of the board is a 9Ã—9 board.
## Compile
